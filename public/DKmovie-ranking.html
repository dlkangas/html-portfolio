<h1>Top Movies According to Dorothy</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Batman Begins</h3>
<p>This is a great story of good versus evil before all the Batman movies became too violent for me.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>We watched this when the boys were young and it's a delightful anime movie by the famous Japanese film maker.</p>

<h3>Gone with the Wind</h3>
<p>The book was great, the movie was great and on a big screen it's an amazing movie.</p>
