<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm new at website development, but very experienced in project management
  as my profession and knitting as my pasttime.</p>

<p>I've lived in Illinois most of my life, but spent some time as a child in
  Wisconsin, as a student in Michigan and as a USAF officer in Massachusetts. I love to travel
and am learning French so I can live in France one day.</p>

<p>I'm active on social media - mostly Twitter where I lean heavy left/blue and sweat like a sailor.
  I avoid Facebook at all costs because it is mostly toxic. To be honest, Twitter is pretty much
  toxic now too with the little wcn owner Elon. I sometimes go to Instagram, Pinterest and other social
  media sites, but mostly I just like to stay home, read, knit and learn French.</p>
